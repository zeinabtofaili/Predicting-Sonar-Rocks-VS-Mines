# Sonar Mines vs Rocks Classifier

Welcome to the Sonar Mines vs Rocks classification project. This project focuses on the analysis and classification of sonar return data to differentiate between metal objects (mines) and rocks.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to process and analyze the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset. The dataset provides sonar data, aiming to accurately classify objects underwater as either a mine or a rock based on the returned sonar data.

## Dataset Description

- **Data Points**: Each entry in the dataset consists of a set of 60 numerical values. 
- **Range**: These values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
- **Representation**: These values signify the energy within a specific frequency band integrated over a particular duration.
- **Labels**: Each record is labeled with:
  - 'R' indicating the object is a rock.
  - 'M' signifying the object is a mine (metal).
